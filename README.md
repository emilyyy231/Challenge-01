# Challenge-01

In this project, an HTML file and CSS stylesheet were refactored to make the webpage "Horiseon Marketing Webpage" fully functional and the code easier to navigate. The source code is now fully semantic HTML, the style elements follow a logical structure(sequential order of appearance on webpage), all navigational links work correctly, and the webpage is more accessible for people with sight disabilities(alternative attributes for images). The webpage has also been optimized for search engines(addition of a title element)

## Usage

Deploy webpage by searching "Horiseon Marketing Webpage" or clicking an active link
